To start using clTEM, there are only two steps!

1. Set and Opencl device using the [OpenCL dialog]() in the <code>Settings &rarr; OpenCL</code> menu.
2. Open a valid [input structure]() using the <code>File &rarr; Open</code> menu.

That's it!

Of course there are many settings to play around with. The [Guide]() pages go through these in detail.
