When you open clTEM, you will be greeted by the main window shown below. The user interface is split into several 'panels' that contain various settings or show information. Some of these have multiple tabs for the different settings. From these panels, multiple dialogs may be opened that may also accessible from the menu bar.

The page will give a brief overview of the interface elements. Each panel has it's own page with an in-depth explaination.

## Panels

### Output

The output panel is where the results of the simulations are displayed and stored. This also also where the data can be exported for use in other applications.

### Overview

This panel gives a quick overview of the size of the simulation, in particular the real and reciprocal scale. Here you can toggle the use of the full 3D approximation, set the simulation resolution and open the dialog to set the simulation area.

### Settings

This panel contains the majority of the settings used for most simulation. This includes setting the microscope parameters, aberrations and setting inelastic/incoherent effects. Many of the panels have further settings available from a dialog when pressing <code>More</code>

See more [here]()

### Mode

The primary functions of this panel is to select the simulation mode. The active tab will be the type of simulation performed. Further to this are some settings the apply only to that simulation type (e.g. STEM detectors).

### Run

This panel is where simulations are started and cancelled. The iterations used for incoherent effects is also set there. If no incoherent effects are enabled, <code>(N/A)</code> is displayed in the text box.
